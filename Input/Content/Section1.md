The presented qualification report evaluates the predictive performance of the OSP suite to predict cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8)-mediated drug clearance in children.

Therefore, PBPK models of specific *in vivo* probe substances covering children aged below 6 months up to adolescents were built and evaluated. All models are whole-body PBPK models, allowing for dynamic pediatric translation in organs expressing CYP2C8. The qualification report demonstrates the level of confidence of the OSP suite with regard to reliable PBPK predictions of age-related CYP2C8-mediated drug clearance during model-informed drug development. The presented PBPK models as well as the respective qualification plan and qualification report are provided open-source and transparently documented (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Pediatric-Qualification-Package-CYP2C8). 


## Translation of Adult PBPK to Children

Using a developed and validated (adult) PBPK model for an *in vivo* probe substance, a pediatric PBPK model can be established for children by translating physiology, clearance processes (as parameterized in the adult model) and age-dependent protein binding including the variability therein.[[1](#reference)]

The PBPK models are developed with clinical data of healthy adult subjects obtained from the literature, covering available dosing ranges for e.g. intravenous as well as oral administration, to capture both systemic clearance as well gut-wall metabolic clearance processes. For orally administered drugs, the same formulations that are used in children should ideally be included in the model for adults. Plasma concentrations following multiple-dose application, mass balance information and other clinical measurements need to be included for model development, if available. During model translation from adults to children for a specific substance, uncertainties in data-quality caused by impact of disease or the target study population, inaccurate in vitro assay-techniques regarding mass balance, as well as study differences may cause not being able to adequately predict the PK in children for all reported studies. 

Prediction performance of the PBPK model for these probe substances in children are then shown by means of e.g. predicted versus observed area under the plasma concentration (AUC)-ratio plots, of which the results support an adequate prediction of the ontogeny function for the application of PBPK model translation of adult PBPK to children.

For qualification purpose, during the translation of adult PBPK to children the following assumptions and considerations were made: 

- when translating an adult model to children, it was assumed that the metabolism and excretion pathways are qualitatively the same in children and in adults.
- no further changes to input parameters other than those for the physiology and protein binding. All other parameters (e.g. lipophilicity, intestinal permeability, solubility) were kept unchanged.

## Anthropometric and Physiological Information 

Regarding the age-dependencies of the relevant anthropometric (height, weight) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, binding protein concentrations, hematocrit, cardiac output) in children was gathered from the literature and has been previously published [[2](#reference)]. The information was incorporated into PK-Sim® and was used as default values for the simulations in children.

The CYP2C8 ontogeny function is reported by Upreti et al. [[3](#reference)] and was integrated into PK-Sim. The ontogeny of CYP2C8 reaches 15% of adult activity at birth, peaks at 260% of adult activity around the age of 14 months and reaches adult activity by the age of 5 to 6 years. The applied ontogeny and variability of other active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim® for translation to children, are described in the publicly available ‘PK-Sim® Ontogeny Database Version 7.3' [[4](#reference)] or otherwise referenced for the specific process.

### Qualification of **CYP2C8 enzyme ontogeny**

To qualify the OSP suite for the pediatric translation of the pharmacokinetics of new drugs that are metabolized by CYP2C8, the following probe substance was included:

- Montelukast [[5](#reference)]
